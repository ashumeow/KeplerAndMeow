Love can be created between any species.
Love is formed through attraction, where attraction is created through electromagnetic gravitational pull 
that occurs in artricles and ventricles, thereby creating feelings which blooms the stimuli all over the body.
The attraction is created through hologram-like process & feelings are generated as signals into wire-like nerves.

Mechanism:-
Love comes under one of the emotions generated by any living species.
The mechanism of love emotion is caused through attraction on watching another living species.
This pull of attraction is due to bandwidth that is generated in human nerves.
The creation of network bandwidth is anonymous.
