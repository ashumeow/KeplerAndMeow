No living species in Earth knew where aliens live...
No living species knew how far aliens are from us...
No living species could predict the distance between humans in earth and aliens...
No living species have an offline to track aliens through signals...
Signals are more enough... The thing is:- How to build it?

Had a dream in evening of going/passing into a larger hole...
I just came out...
I thought that it was my college, but it was not my college at all...
It was more like another world...
While typing these words itself, my body is shivering and i don't know why...
While we dream in sleep, we humans make a mistake of running or moving backwards or escape and then, we wake up.
For first time in life, i realized that i am dreaming while i am really in deep sleep.
Earlier, i made mistakes by waking up. I was stable this time maintaining unconsiousness.
(Here... there was no day dream.. we often get such dream while we are consiousness).
I stepped forwards and went downstairs...
I went down and i realized that i am in different world.
I came out of the door and i found some species applausing at me.
I was wondering why are they applausing at me?
I didn't see them closely, but they actually resembled like humans.
And then, i woke up from bed trying to breathe. And my heart was aching.

Isn't it creepy?

Since childhood till 2014, i get more strange dreams which i can't share it here.
Because it's even creepy.
