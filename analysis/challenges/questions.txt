How to connect? => network
Why to connect? => To explore
Where to connect? => other planets/galaxies

Should we connect? => yes

What are the possibilities?
How can it be possible?
Will it be possible? => Yes!

Before connecting, a tracker is required.
How to track? => Geo-locator (existing)
Why to track? => To record the connecting distance and analyze it (existing)
How to build a tracker? => There are existing ones.
How to extend? => network, performance, signals (needs improvements)
How to implement static tracking (tracking over longer distant planets/solar systems)? => satellites (existing)
How to implement dynamic tracking? =>

How to start tracker before connect? => geo-tracker (existing)
How to integrate track with connect? => capturing the distance and performing calculations (exisiting)
