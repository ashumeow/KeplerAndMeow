Watched one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ6Gb3iZ1Lo">complex documentary on time</a> which freaked me off.
```
Sadly, I didn't watch full video because I easily moody when I get turned off by something that tries to tangled my brain.
At first few minutes, it's worth to watch how NIST shows how time has been "scientifically calculated"?
Also, the tick-tock of a second that was stimulated in calculating the exact approximate value was shown.
I don't judge any video. Maybe, because my learning expectation level could be different.
Who can watch that video?
It is worth to watch the whole video if you would like to know the scientific calculation of time and how it's done.

Why would you need to explain something much simpler in a complex way?

Does time really exist? ---> Not bad to ask silly question
Time can exist or not exist too.
We the humans are the ones who invented time, which is something that God never created. LOL

If you were born in 90s and attentive in your 3rd grade social science class on early man lectures.
Then, you would remember about our social science teacher who explains about time.
During ancient days, there was nothing to calculate.
The early men/women wanted to know when the sunrise occurs and when the sunset occurs.
That is where time was born.
Then, sand clock was invented.
Later on, scientific calculator was invented, then scientific clocks and followed by scientific watches.

Why time?
Time helps us to plan and schedule.
Time helps us to determine our healthy sleeping and eating level.

In my definition, time is nothing but a span.
The period is the difference between the time start and time end.
The nearest end time is the deadline.
Our time span deadline is determined by our health.
Health can be determined from us only.

Mainly, the longer distances between Earth and other exoplanets helps us to determine the time it takes to travel.

Imagine what happens if there was no time… 
Then, how can we determine how long it takes to travel from one planet to another?

Concluding in a funny way…
You are going for a friendly hang-out everytime. Woman needs 30mins to get ready. 
Man requires just 10mins to arrive on-spot. 

If there was no time, then how will you tell him to come after 30mins everytime.
If there was no time, then he will arrive soon and he will be waiting everytime.
He will go nuts at one instant saying that you never come fast. He might stop meeting you after that too.
Time also helps to avoid conflicts.

I can write more, but i made it crisp for now. Maybe, in future...for extending or relating something! ;)
