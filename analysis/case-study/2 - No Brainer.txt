As an addicted watcher and subscriber of vSauce, I used to like most of his videos. 
But, there was one video which I didn't like that much [1].

Actually, vSauce was demonstrating what can one do without a brain. 
The chicken/hen example was pretty much interesting. As of humans, the explanation wasn't that good enough. 
I wasn't satisfied since I already have good pure-zoology knowledge of 6 years. I mean that it was in school. 

Coming back to the study… 
Chicken/hen and Cockroaches are different belonging to different family of living species. 
Cockroaches have an open-circulatory system,
which is why their bodies will be in continuous circulation,
even after their brains gets cut off and they can survive for some weeks.

He said that reflexes are no-brainer. I don't think so. 
Reflexes [2] are generated as a stimulus, where the stimulus is initiated from nerves… 
Nerves are all in-relationship with the brain.. Didn't understand, right? 
Our brain is the main power supply. 
We could also relate that to Tesla unfinished wireless electricity transmitter if we have good imagination. 
Nerves can't function without a brain. 

If you were studying in school during 90s and if you were attentive in your early classes, 
then you would came across something called the central nervous system [3]. 
Only the things and parts of the central nervous systems are associated with the brain. 
The other parts are not related with the brain. 
That's why our zoology teachers always separately teach circulatory system, nervous system, digestive system & reproductive system.

Yet… 
The other systems such as circulatory system, digestive system and reproductive system are also gained brain power...
How?
It's through wireless form like how wireless devices are connected to internet (nerves) via main power supply (brain).

He said that we humans immediately die after brain goes. 
I don't think so. 
Humans can live for few days and then, they die without any consciousness without knowing their loved ones or anything. 
Everything goes blank. 
Haven't you heard of brain tumor or brain comma? A person can be inside the ward during brain comma stage alive for few days. 
Mostly, they will die within a week.

I could still write more on this relating to computer networks and physics. Maybe as separate study! ;)
