Love can be created between any species.
Love is formed through attraction, where attraction is created through electromagnetic gravitational pull 
that occurs in artricles and ventricles, thereby creating feelings which blooms the stimuli all over the body.
The attraction is created through hologram-like process & feelings are generated as signals into wire-like nerves.

Mechanism:-
Love comes under one of the emotions generated by any living species.
The mechanism of love emotion is caused through attraction on watching another living species.
This pull of attraction on watching another species appearance/activities/similar stufs,
which increases the bandwidth that will generate in human nerves.
The creation of such network bandwidth is anonymous.

How love connectivity is done?
The connectivity is done in between the living species through invisible signals that creates authentication.
After authentication, the signals does processes among one another, which in human terms is referred as dating.

For longer adaption..
1. Understanding - This is a method that is done though extracting & binding of other signals through observation.
2. Trust - This is generated through belief, where the signals tend to stay confident over its opposite signals.
3. Communication - This is done by interaction between two signals helping in knowing eachother through data transfer.
4.
