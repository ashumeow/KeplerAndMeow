The hand movements and leg movements are done with the help of the brain.
The mechanism is being associated with the brain
Every living species from every categories MUST require a brain inorder to make any hand movement or a leg movement.

Relation:-
The mechanism of hand-leg movements can be related in any ways...
Relation 1: Mobile Cruise Controller
In mobile cruise controller, the movement is mainly done through programming.
Here, the brain can be related to the instructions that are passed for the cruise to make movements.
Relation 2: Querying
In querying, the dataset is already stored in database that gets imported while the body requires movement.
left <- move left ## instruction gets imported from the dataset
Relation 3: Languages/Scripts
In languages/scripts, it helps the living species to program in a non-human format and help machines to understand.
Similarly, the living species are also genetically programmed through DNA replication.
