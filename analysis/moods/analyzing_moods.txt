(In human aspects...)
Analyze yourself...
You feel something... happy or sad or angry or silent or blank or romantic... which are moods!
The question you must ask yourself is:- 
1. "How do you feel it?"
Answer: ???
2. "How do you get moods?"
Answer: Through feelings... Feelings come as the consequence of a situation that living species face.

The 1st question is still unsolved...
Come your eyes...
Then, open your eyes and stare at me... i meant the computer screen..
You feel something like you will feel to say --- "WTF?" or "How dumb!" or something that hit your mind...
On reading these lines, you will breathe.. you will wonder.. these are feelings that wander in your nerves.

When you look deep inside about your feelings... 
Every thing you feel or feel by a touch, "wave signals" are penetrated through your nerves and then, feelings starts.
Feelings come from your "heart".
Heart is filled with beats... like a music beat..
Find it lame, huh?
Take a guitar.. move your fingers towards the strings... then, music is generated.. 
Can you predict how many possible beats get generated within few seconds? It's hard, right?
Similarly with the feelings..
Love is the most dangerous feeling because it has got extreme tangled beats.
Anger is also another dangerous feeling.
Sadness isn't that dangerous feelings, unless extreme pessimistic feelings gets overly combined.
