Thinking can be related to "search engines".
Thoughts are the collection of thinking pieces.
The collection of thoughts will be stored in the brain database known as memory.
Each thought will be allocated in a memory register, where the thoughts will be accessed if living creature requires in future.

A crazy relation of brain with networks:-
Extending the thinking power results in connecting with dots.
Connecting with dots is more like interconnecting with nodes,
where the brain of the living creature is interconnection of nodes results in forming a neural network.
To prove that thinking can be related to search engines,
We living species think...
Every thinking connects and forms a tangled web where it helps in recalling the information.
The memory depends upon the server performance, where the memory database resides in the brain server.
If server crashes, then the memory will be recover.

The questions on Thinking:-
Why do we think? 
How do we think? 
When do we think? 
What should we think?
