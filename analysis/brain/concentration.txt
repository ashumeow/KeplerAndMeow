Focus comes from the interest towards the challenging tasks.

Analyzing the gender-based predictive evaluation (Out of 100%)
Why Males gain more focus than Females?
Because, Males have 10% feelings only in heart, 20% in their body skin and 70% in their reproductive parts.
Whereas, Female have 50% feelings in heart and 50% in physical.
Since, Men have very less feelings in heart, so their mind will always stay in control.
Whereas, Women have more feelings in heart and sometimes, they get driven into emotions due to hormones.
But, Women can control their mind unless they understand themselves.
This doesn't mean that Men are more genius than Women.
Because, Brain capacity for both men and women are same.
Focus and Implementation is what matters... 
And how one can relate it to another can help a living creature in the area of logical/practical thinking.
