The term "Dreams" can be related to "Shuffling Cards".
One can not easily predict the cards while shuffling. But, it's possible to predict through logical calculations.
Similarly, dreams are a shuffled art of visual images. 
Sometimes, one can predict their own hidden potential and the future if they can crack the logic in dreams.
But, it takes some hardwork inorder to crack and hack the logic since dreams hit only when a living creature is asleep.
Since, brain is in-built with the potentiality to think, So why dreams are crazy?
Dreams can come in any living species. But, why dreams are crazy again?
While a living creature is awake, the consious button hits the brain and hence, the living creature gets the ability to think.
But, dreams comes when a living creature is wide asleep and dreams controls since the consiousness button is turned off.

Dream sequence:-
When dream A relates with dream B, then next dream will be followed by C and so on. Whereas, the dream A never comes back.
This is indicator that one has connected dreams with sequences and possibilities.
