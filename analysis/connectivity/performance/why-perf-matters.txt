Earlier, an engineer [1] who shared his views about his goal to bring the speed of web equivalent to the speed of light,
Which made me understood that a light has everything and can bring miracles. Physics never lies!
After watching an inspirational documentary on Tesla [2], who also believed that light is everything.

Case 1:- Transmission of Signals from one planet to anywhere outside the planet
Light is currently amplified through wired electricity, though Tesla believed in his unfinished dream of wireless electricity.
If the signals are transmitted in the speed of light, then it's possible to reach light years through just signals.
The signals requires a network that could connect and record the distance it travels in the speed of light.
Examples:
Voyager 1 travels at the speed of 62,136kph which is equivalent to 5.7573162831201E-8 c. But, it's less.
Similarly Voyager 2 travels at the speed of 57,888kph which is equivalent to 5.3637106507863E-8 c. But, it's also less.
Because generally, 1 light speed is equivalent to 1079252848.8 kph
For exploration itself, the speed isn't enough. Time isn't more, it's less.

Case 2:- The possibility of living species travelling in light speed
This can be initially set into possibility once when case-1 becomes possible.

Case 3:- The possibility of bringing back the living species safely to Earth
This can be initially set into possibility once when case-2 becomes possible.
